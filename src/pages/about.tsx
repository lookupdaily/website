        GET OUT NOW. Not just outside, but beyond the trap of the programmed
        electronic age so gently closing around so many people at the end of our
        century. Go outside, move deliberately, then relax, slow down, look
        around. Do not jog. Do not run. Forget about blood pressure and
        arthritis, cardiovascular rejuvenation and weight reduction. Instead pay
        attention to everything that abuts the rural road, the city street, the
        suburban boulevard. Walk. Stroll. Saunter. Ride a bike, and coast along
        a lot. Explore.
